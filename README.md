![Cosmic messengers on their way to Earth.](./cm_overview.png "Cosmic Messengers")

## Usage
In the root directory, call
```
$ make [all,build/cm_overview.pdf]
```
to build the graphic. An installation of TeXLive is required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the way TikZ handles shadings, some PDF viewers do not display the shadings and color gradients
> in this graphic. The same applies for printers. To circumvent this, please convert the PDFs to PNGs
> using the `convert_png` target of the Makefile. Per default this will create PNGs with a DPI value of
> 600. For higher resolutions change the value accordingly.
